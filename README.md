# Temp_and_pressure_moniter_system
This is an arduino based project in having a wi-fi module, Temp. sensor and pressure sensor. Aim of this project is to 
make portable, simple and small modules which can be mounted anywhere to monitor the temp. and pressure of that place like 
in a room, motor, engine etc. to monitor the temp and pressure of the system. 
There are such multiple modules to be mounted in an area and all the slave modules will be connected to a master module having same config. with additional LCD and storage device mounted to display and store the log of all the devices. All the devices are 
powered by a rechargable battery mounted on them . If the modules are to be used in open area, then a solar panel can also be used
to charge the battery at daytime and give power to system at night without even recharging the battery.
